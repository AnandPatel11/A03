Glossary:
>Branch: Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

>Clone: Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.

>Commit: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.

>Fetch: Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.

>Git: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

>Github: GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

>Merge: Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

>Merge Conflict: Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

>Push: Pushing sends the recent commit history from your local repository up to GitHub.

>Pull: A pull grabs any changes from the GitHub repository and merges them into your local repository.

>Remote: A remote repository in Git, also called a remote, is a Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network.

>Repository: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
